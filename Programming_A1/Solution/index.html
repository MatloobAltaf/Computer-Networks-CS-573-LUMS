We experience it as an emotion, but the feeling of love,<br>
our desire to be close to the beloved,<br>
is actually an unconscious expression<br>
of the dynamic nature of sub-atomic particles eternally trying to regroup as singularity<br>
that was there premordial state.<br>
Simply Love is a Quantum 
Event.
